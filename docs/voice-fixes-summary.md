# Voice Feature Fixes - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Error Popup After Recording ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "Voice Error: Connection failed" popup appeared even when voice functionality was working correctly.

**Root Cause**: Any Azure OpenAI Realtime API error event (including non-fatal ones like turn detection issues) was triggering the error popup.

**Solution**: 
- Modified error handling in `foundryVoiceService.ts` to only treat fatal errors as connection failures
- Non-fatal errors (turn detection, transient issues) are now logged as warnings but don't trigger the popup
- Fatal errors that warrant the popup: `session_expired`, `invalid_session`, `authentication_failed`

**File Changed**: `apps/mobile/services/foundryVoiceService.ts`

### 2. No Conversation Context ✅ VERIFIED WORKING
**Problem**: Voice sessions didn't maintain context from previous chat messages.

**Status**: Already implemented correctly!
- `conversationId` is being passed from `ChatScreen.tsx` (line 298)
- Backend receives and uses it in `VoiceController.cs` (line 45)
- Each voice session maintains the thread context

**No changes needed** - this feature was already working as designed.

### 3. Female Voice Instead of Uncle Voice ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Voice was using "alloy" (female, neutral) instead of an uncle-like voice.

**Solution**: Changed default voice to "onyx" (male, deep, authoritative)
- **onyx**: Deep male voice, perfect for an experienced uncle figure
- Alternative option: **echo** (male, confident voice)

**Files Changed**:
- `services/api/appsettings.json` - Changed `DefaultVoice` from "alloy" to "onyx"
- `services/api/appsettings.Development.json` - Changed `DefaultVoice` from "alloy" to "onyx"

## Available Voice Options

Azure OpenAI Realtime API supports these voices:
- **alloy** - Female, neutral
- **echo** - Male, confident  
- **fable** - Male, expressive
- **onyx** - Male, deep, authoritative ⭐ **Now default - perfect for Gamer Uncle**
- **nova** - Female, warm
- **shimmer** - Female, soft

## Testing Instructions

### To Test the Fixes:

1. **Restart the API server** to pick up the new voice configuration:
   - The API server needs to be restarted in the separate PowerShell window
   - Or run: `dotnet run --project services/api/GamerUncle.Api.csproj --urls 'http://0.0.0.0:5001'`

2. **Reload the Expo app** to get the updated error handling:
   - Press `r` in the Expo Metro terminal to reload
   - Or shake the device and select "Reload"

3. **Test Voice Session**:
   - Start a new voice session
   - Ask a question (e.g., "What games are good for 4 players?")
   - Listen for the male "onyx" voice in the response
   - Check that no error popup appears (unless there's a genuine fatal error)
   
4. **Test Conversation Context**:
   - Ask a follow-up question that references the previous conversation
   - The AI should remember the context from earlier in the conversation

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

✅ Voice responses in deep male "onyx" voice (uncle-like)
✅ No error popup for normal operation
✅ Conversation context maintained across voice sessions
✅ Only fatal errors trigger error popup
✅ Non-fatal errors logged but don't interrupt the session

## Rollback Instructions

If you want to revert to the female voice:
```json
"DefaultVoice": "alloy"  // or "nova" for warmer female voice
```

If you want to try the other male voice:
```json
"DefaultVoice": "echo"  // male, confident but less deep than onyx
```

## Implementation Details

### Error Classification Logic

```typescript
const errorCode = event.error?.code || event.code;
const isFatalError = errorCode === 'session_expired' || 
                    errorCode === 'invalid_session' || 
                    errorCode === 'authentication_failed';

if (isFatalError) {
  // Show error popup
  this.notifyConnectionStateChange('failed');
} else {
  // Log as warning, continue session
  console.warn('⚠️ Non-fatal error - continuing session');
}
```

This ensures that transient API errors (like turn detection adjustments) don't disrupt the user experience.
