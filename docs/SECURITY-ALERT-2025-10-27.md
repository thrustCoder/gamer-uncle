# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SECURITY ALERT

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED - Keys Rotated

## Issue

Azure Speech Service API keys were accidentally committed to git in commit `89804b5`:

- **Dev Key:** `7TbBhjq...ACOGDrhA` (westus) - âœ… ROTATED
- **Prod Key:** `3zTBdxz...ACOG1O3J` (westus) - âœ… ROTATED

## Actions Completed

1. âœ… Keys removed from configuration files
2. âœ… `.gitignore` updated to prevent future commits
3. âœ… Configuration guide created (`CONFIGURATION.md`)
4. âœ… Commit with exposed keys reverted locally
5. âœ… **Dev key rotated** - New key: `75607ede...170671`
6. âœ… **Prod key rotated** - New key: `668cfc41...ffced8`
7. âœ… **Dev key configured in user secrets** for local development
8. âœ… **Prod key configured in Azure App Service** (gamer-uncle-prod-app-svc)
9. âœ… **Dev App Service updated** (gamer-uncle-dev-app-svc)
10. âœ… **API tested and healthy** - Health endpoint responding correctly

## REQUIRED ACTIONS

### 1. Rotate Azure Speech Service Keys (IMMEDIATE)

**Development Resource:**
```bash
az cognitiveservices account keys regenerate \
  --name gamer-uncle-dev-speech \
  --resource-group gamer-uncle-dev-rg \
  --key-name key1
```

**Production Resource:**
```bash
az cognitiveservices account keys regenerate \
  --name gamer-uncle-prod-speech \
  --resource-group gamer-uncle-prod-rg \
  --key-name key1
```

### 2. Update Configuration

After rotating keys, configure the new keys using environment variables or user secrets:

```powershell
# Development
dotnet user-secrets set "AzureSpeech:Key" "NEW-DEV-KEY" --project services/api

# Production (in Azure App Service Configuration)
# Add Application Setting: AzureSpeech__Key = NEW-PROD-KEY
```

### 3. Git History Cleanup (Optional but Recommended)

The exposed keys still exist in git history. Options:

**Option A: Rewrite history (if not pushed to remote):**
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Remove the commits with keys
```

**Option B: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner (if already pushed):**
```bash
bfg --replace-text passwords.txt  # Create file with old keys
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
git push --force
```

**Option C: Consider keys compromised and rotate (safest)**
- This is the recommended approach
- Assume the keys may have been accessed
- Rotate both keys immediately

### 4. Update CI/CD Pipelines

Ensure all pipelines use the NEW rotated keys:

1. Azure DevOps: Update variable groups
2. GitHub Actions: Update repository secrets
3. Local development: Update user secrets

### 5. Monitor for Unauthorized Usage

Check Azure Monitor logs for any suspicious activity:
- Unusual geographic locations
- Unexpected usage spikes
- Failed authentication attempts with old keys

## Prevention for Future

1. âœ… Added `appsettings.*.local.json` to `.gitignore`
2. âœ… Created `CONFIGURATION.md` with proper setup instructions
3. âœ… All configuration files now have empty `Key` values
4. Use user secrets for local development
5. Use Azure Key Vault for production

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Dev key rotated in Azure Portal
- [x] Prod key rotated in Azure Portal
- [x] New dev key configured in user secrets
- [x] New prod key configured in Azure App Service (Prod)
- [x] New dev key configured in Azure App Service (Dev)
- [x] API tested with new keys (health endpoint) - âœ… Healthy
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines updated with new keys (if applicable)
- [ ] No unauthorized usage detected in logs
- [ ] Team notified of key rotation

**Remember:** API keys are secrets. Treat them like passwords. Never commit them to git.
