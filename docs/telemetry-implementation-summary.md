# Application Insights Telemetry Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Completed

Your API and Functions projects are now fully configured with Application Insights telemetry using RBAC with managed identities.

## 📦 Dependencies Added

### API Project (`GamerUncle.Api.csproj`)
- `Azure.Identity` v1.13.1
- `Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore` v1.2.0
- `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore` v2.22.0

### Functions Project (`GamerUncle.Function.BggSync.csproj`)
- `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WorkerService` v2.22.0

## 🔧 Code Changes Made

### 1. API Project (`Program.cs`)
- Added Application Insights with OpenTelemetry configuration
- Configured to use `DefaultAzureCredential` for RBAC authentication
- Connection string configuration from `appsettings.json`

### 2. Functions Project (`Program.cs`)
- Added Application Insights WorkerService
- Configured to read connection string from environment variable
- Uses RBAC authentication automatically

### 3. Enhanced AgentServiceClient
- **Comprehensive telemetry integration**:
  - Custom events tracking (`AgentRequest.Started`, `AgentRequest.Completed`, etc.)
  - Performance metrics (`AgentRequest.Duration`, `AgentRequest.MatchingGames`)
  - Exception tracking with context
  - Request correlation with unique IDs
- **Structured logging** with ILogger
- **Graceful handling** of null telemetry clients

### 4. Configuration Files
- Updated `appsettings.json` with Application Insights section
- Environment variable support for Functions

## 📊 Telemetry Events Tracked

### Custom Events
- `AgentRequest.Started` - When a request begins
- `AgentRequest.NoCriteria` - When no search criteria are found
- `AgentRequest.WithRAG` - When using RAG approach with game data
- `AgentRequest.Completed` - When request completes successfully

### Metrics
- `AgentRequest.Duration` - Request processing time in milliseconds
- `AgentRequest.MatchingGames` - Number of games found in database

### Properties Tracked
- User input text
- Thread IDs for conversation tracking
- Request IDs for correlation
- Matching games count
- Response length
- Error context when exceptions occur

## 🧪 Unit Tests Created

### API Tests (`AgentServiceClientTelemetryTests.cs`)
- Constructor validation with telemetry components
- Null handling for optional dependencies
- Configuration validation
- Telemetry structure validation

### Functions Tests (`FunctionsTelemetryTests.cs`)
- Host builder configuration testing
- Connection string validation
- Service registration verification

## 📝 Next Steps for Azure Portal Configuration

Follow the detailed guide in `/docs/application-insights-rbac-setup.md`:

1. **Get Application Insights Connection String**
2. **Enable Managed Identity** for App Service and Function App
3. **Assign RBAC roles** (`Monitoring Metrics Publisher`)
4. **Configure application settings** with connection string
5. **Verify telemetry** in Application Insights portal

## 🔍 What You'll See in Application Insights

Once deployed and configured:

### Live Metrics
- Real-time request counts
- Performance counters
- Active users

### Application Map
- Service dependencies
- Performance hotspots
- Failure rates

### Logs (KQL Queries)
```kql
// Custom events from your API
customEvents
| where name startswith "AgentRequest"
| order by timestamp desc

// Request performance
requests
| where success == true
| summarize avg(duration) by bin(timestamp, 5m)

// Exception tracking
exceptions
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| order by timestamp desc
```

### Performance Insights
- Request duration trends
- Game recommendation performance
- Database query performance
- Exception patterns

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

- **🔐 Security**: No connection strings in code, uses managed identities
- **📈 Observability**: Comprehensive telemetry across the application
- **🐛 Debugging**: Detailed error tracking and performance insights
- **📊 Analytics**: Business metrics on game recommendations
- **🔄 Correlation**: Request tracking across services
- **⚡ Performance**: Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities

## 🚀 Ready for Production

Your application is now enterprise-ready with:
- Proper security practices (RBAC)
- Comprehensive monitoring
- Performance tracking
- Error diagnostics
- Business intelligence capabilities

Deploy your applications and follow the portal configuration guide to start seeing telemetry data in Application Insights!
