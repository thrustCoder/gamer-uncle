# Push-to-Talk Implementation Phases

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation approach for adding push-to-talk functionality to Gamer Uncle, following the architecture patterns established in the codebase.

## Phase 0: Security Infrastructure Setup

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective

### ðŸ“‹ Tasks

#### Azure Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure Azure Front Door for existing App Service
- [ ] Set up WAF policies with rate limiting rules
- [ ] Configure health probes using existing `/health` endpoint
- [ ] Set up origin routing for `/api/*` paths
- [ ] Disable caching for API endpoints (dynamic content)

#### Security Policies
- [ ] Implement geographic restrictions if needed
- [ ] Configure bot protection rules
- [ ] Set up custom WAF rules for common attack patterns
- [ ] Configure global and per-IP rate limiting

#### Configuration Updates
- [ ] Update mobile app `API_BASE_URL` to point to AFD endpoint
- [ ] Update pipeline deployment configs for AFD routing
- [ ] Configure CORS policies through AFD

#### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Verify existing `/api/recommendations` endpoint works through AFD
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality through new routing
- [ ] Run functional tests against AFD endpoint
- [ ] Validate E2E tests with new API base URL

### âœ… Success Criteria
- All existing API functionality works through Azure Front Door
- Rate limiting policies are enforced correctly
- E2E and functional tests pass with AFD routing
- Security policies are active and logging properly

### ðŸ“‹ Testing

#### Backend Tests
- [ ] Create `VoiceControllerTests.cs` in `services/tests/functional/`
- [ ] Test valid voice session creation
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid gameId, zero players)
- [ ] Test rate limiting on voice endpoints
- [ ] Follow anti-fallback testing patterns

#### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Create `useVoiceSession.test.ts` with React Native Testing Library
- [ ] Mock WebRTC dependencies
- [ ] Test session lifecycle (start/stop)
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] Add voice endpoint to E2E test suite
- [ ] Test voice session creation through AFD
- [ ] Validate correlation ID tracking

### âœ… Success Criteria
- Voice session endpoint responds correctly
- Mobile app can request voice sessions
- WebRTC connection establishes successfully
- All tests pass including rate limiting
- Basic mic button UI is functional
