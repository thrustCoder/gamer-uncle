# Push-to-Talk Implementation Phases

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation approach for adding push-to-talk functionality to Gamer Uncle, following the architecture patterns established in the codebase.

## Phase 0: Security Infrastructure Setup

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Establish Azure Front Door (AFD) and Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection for all API endpoints before implementing voice features.

### ðŸ“‹ Tasks

#### Azure Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure Azure Front Door for existing App Service
- [ ] Set up WAF policies with rate limiting rules
- [ ] Configure health probes using existing `/health` endpoint
- [ ] Set up origin routing for `/api/*` paths
- [ ] Disable caching for API endpoints (dynamic content)

#### Security Policies
- [ ] Implement geographic restrictions if needed
- [ ] Configure bot protection rules
- [ ] Set up custom WAF rules for common attack patterns
- [ ] Configure global and per-IP rate limiting

#### Configuration Updates
- [ ] Update mobile app `API_BASE_URL` to point to AFD endpoint
- [ ] Update pipeline deployment configs for AFD routing
- [ ] Configure CORS policies through AFD

#### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Verify existing `/api/recommendations` endpoint works through AFD
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality through new routing
- [ ] Run functional tests against AFD endpoint
- [ ] Validate E2E tests with new API base URL

### âœ… Success Criteria
- All existing API functionality works through Azure Front Door
- Rate limiting policies are enforced correctly
- E2E and functional tests pass with AFD routing
- Security policies are active and logging properly
